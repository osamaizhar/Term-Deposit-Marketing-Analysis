From Data to Decisions: A Complete Journey Through Term Deposit Marketing Analysis
Uncovering insights and building predictive models for banking marketing success

---

In the world of banking marketing, every call costs money, but every missed subscriber costs even more. This comprehensive analysis takes you through the complete journey from raw data exploration to production-ready predictive models, revealing the hidden patterns that separate successful marketing campaigns from expensive failures.
The Business Challenge
Our dataset contains 40,000 customer records from a Portuguese bank's direct marketing campaign for term deposits. With an overall subscription rate of just 7.24%, the stakes are high: How do we identify which customers to call before making expensive outreach attempts?
The goal isn't just prediction accuracy - it's maximizing subscriber capture while minimizing wasted resources.

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis - The Foundation
1.1 Data Foundation: What We're Working With
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('term-deposit-marketing-2020.csv')
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")

Dataset PreviewKey Statistics:
40,000 customer records across 14 features
Zero missing values - excellent data quality
No duplicate records - clean dataset ready for analysis

1.2 The Correlation Revolution: What Drives Success?
# Convert target to binary
df['y_bin'] = df['y'].map({'yes': 1, 'no': 0})
# Analyze numerical correlations
num_features = ["age", "balance", "day", "duration", "campaign"]
corr_with_target = df[num_features + ["y_bin"]].corr()["y_bin"].drop("y_bin")
print("Correlation with subscription success:")
print(corr_with_target.sort_values(ascending=False))
The results reveal a game-changing insight:
Duration: 0.46 correlation - By far the strongest predictor
Balance: 0.03 correlation - Slight positive relationship
Campaign: -0.04 correlation - More contacts = lower success rate

1.3 Demographic Features
# Analyze categorical features
cat_features = ["job", "marital", "education", "default",
                "housing", "loan", "contact", "month"]
for feat in cat_features:
    table = df.groupby(feat)["y_bin"].agg(
        subscription_rate="mean",
        count="count"
    )
    table["subscription_rate"] = (table["subscription_rate"] * 100).round(2)
    print(f"\\\\nSubscription rates by {feat}:")
    print(table.sort_values("subscription_rate", ascending=False).head())

# Part 2: Prediction Models Training for Term Deposit Marketing

## Introduction to Model Building

Creating accurate predictive models is critical for effectively identifying customers most likely to subscribe to term deposits. The core goal is to predict which customers should be targeted before any calls are made, thereby maximizing subscriber capture while minimizing unnecessary calls that incur costs and human effort.

Two distinct models were developed:

1. **Pre-call Model**: Predicts customer subscriptions before initiating calls, excluding campaign-related features such as duration, day, month, and campaign.
2. **Post-call Model**: Predicts which customers should continue receiving calls after initial contact, utilizing all available campaign-related features.

**Previous Step Recap:** After outlining the objectives for the Pre‑Call and Post‑Call models, I reviewed the full list of variables and identified which campaign‑specific fields would introduce data leakage if used before the customer is contacted. This analysis set the stage for the dedicated feature‑selection routine below.

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis developed two predictive models for term deposit marketing optimization:

**Model 1 (Pre-Call):** Achieved 62% recall using Logistic Regression with undersampling, enabling identification of potential subscribers before any contact using only demographic data.

**Model 2 (Post-Call):** Achieved 91% accuracy and 42% precision using XGBoost, dramatically improving follow-up efficiency by leveraging campaign interaction data.

**Key Business Impact:** The combined approach reduces marketing costs by 60% while maintaining 62-79% subscriber capture rates, delivering substantial ROI improvements.

**Customer Insights:** Segmentation analysis revealed two distinct subscriber groups (94% mainstream, 6% niche), enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Data preprocessing is fundamental for developing robust machine‑learning models:

* **Transforming Target Variables:**

  ```python
  data["y"] = data["y"].map({"no": 0, "yes": 1})
  ```

* **Encoding Categorical Variables:**

  ```python
  X_train_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_train, drop_first=True)
  X_test_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_test, drop_first=True)
  ```

This approach ensures categorical data is accurately represented numerically, improving model performance and compatibility.

## Feature Selection for Both Model 1 & Model 2 (Pre-Call & Post-Call)

*In this step, I separate the feature space for each scenario: the pre-call model excludes any campaign-specific columns that could leak post-contact information (e.g., day, month, duration, campaign), while the post-call model retains the full feature set to capture every informative variable available after an initial call.*

```python
# seed = random.randint(1000, 9999)
seed = 6492
print(f"Seed: {seed}")

# Define campaign‑related features to exclude from Model 1
campaign_features = ["duration", "campaign", "day", "month"]

# Check which campaign features actually exist in our dataset
available_campaign_features = [f for f in campaign_features if f in X.columns]
print(f"Available campaign features to exclude: {available_campaign_features}")

# Model 1: Pre‑Call Model (excluding campaign‑related features)
X1 = X.drop(available_campaign_features, axis=1, errors="ignore")
y1 = y

# Model 2: Post‑Call Model (including all features)
X2 = X
y2 = y

print(f"\nModel 1 (Pre‑Call) features ({len(X1.columns)}): {X1.columns.tolist()}")
print(f"\nModel 2 (Post‑Call) features ({len(X2.columns)}): {X2.columns.tolist()}")
print(f"\nFeatures excluded from Model 1: {available_campaign_features}")

X1_train, X1_test, y1_train, y1_test = train_test_split(
    X1, y1, test_size=0.20, random_state=seed
)

X2_train, X2_test, y2_train, y2_test = train_test_split(
    X2, y2, test_size=0.20, random_state=seed
)

# ─── After your train_test_split ─────────────────────────
for df in (X1_train, X1_test, X2_train, X2_test):
    df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

print("\nSplit Shapes:\n")
print(
    f"Model 1 - X Training : {X1_train.shape} | X Test: {X1_test.shape} | Y Train: {y1_train.shape} | Y Test: {y1_test.shape}"
)
print(
    f"Model 2 - X Training: {X2_train.shape} | X Test: {X2_test.shape} | Y Train: {y2_train.shape} | Y Test: {y2_test.shape}"
)

# One‑Hot Encoding helper
def one_hot_encode(X_train, X_test):
    X_train_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_train, drop_first=True)
    X_test_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_test, drop_first=True)
    # Align test columns to train columns (add missing cols with zeros)
    X_test_encoded = X_test_encoded.reindex(
        columns=X_train_encoded.columns, fill_value=0
    )
    return X_train_encoded, X_test_encoded

X1_train_encoded, X1_test_encoded = one_hot_encode(X1_train, X1_test)
X2_train_encoded, X2_test_encoded = one_hot_encode(X2_train, X2_test)
```

## Model 1 (Pre-Call) Evaluation Results

I began by training baseline models using logistic regression, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors based on the data split in the previous step. These initial models provided a benchmark for further improvements. Recognizing the class imbalance, I then applied both **Random Undersampling** and **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to examine their impact on model performance.

## Best Performing Pre-Call Model

Based on the marketing objective of maximizing subscriber capture (recall) while keeping call volume acceptable, **Logistic Regression** emerged as the best-performing model for pre-call prediction.

| Metric                | Logistic Regression | XGBoost | KNN    |
|----------------------|--------------------|---------|--------|
| Recall (Subscribers) | 63%                | 41%     | 1%     |
| Precision            | 10%                | 11%     | 15%    |
| F1 Score             | 0.17               | 0.17    | 0.02   |
| Calls Placed         | 3,630              | 2,073   | 48     |
| Subscribers Captured | 346                | 224     | 7      |

**Summary:**
- All metrics above are calculated for the actual subscribers (positive class) in the test set.
- Logistic Regression achieved the highest recall, meaning it identified the largest proportion of subscribers.
- XGBoost had a similar F1 score, but lower recall than Logistic Regression.
- KNN performed poorly for subscribers, with very low recall and F1 score.
- For business impact, maximizing recall among subscribers is prioritized, making Logistic Regression the best choice for pre-call targeting.

**Note:**
- For Logistic Regression, the classification report shows a recall of 0.63 (63%) for subscribers, precision of 0.10 (10%), and F1 score of 0.17, with an overall accuracy of 56%.

## Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna

After selecting Logistic Regression with Undersampling as the best model, I applied Optuna for hyperparameter optimization to further enhance performance.

### Optimization Process
- **Number of trials**: 40
- **Optimization metric**: F1 score (maximized)
- **Best trial**: Trial #31
- **Best F1 score achieved**: 0.1834

### Optimal Hyperparameters Found
```python
{
    'C': 0.001028,  # Very low regularization strength
    'solver': 'lbfgs',
    'max_iter': 1206,
    'class_weight': 'balanced'
}
```

### Key Findings

1. **Regularization (C parameter)**: The optimal C value is extremely low (0.001028), indicating strong regularization is beneficial for this imbalanced dataset.

2. **Solver**: The 'lbfgs' solver outperformed 'liblinear' for this configuration.

3. **Class weights**: 'balanced' class weights consistently performed better than None, confirming the importance of addressing class imbalance.

### Optuna Implementation Code

```python
import optuna
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

def objective(trial):
    # Hyperparameter search space
    C = trial.suggest_float('C', 0.001, 100.0, log=True)
    solver = trial.suggest_categorical('solver', ['liblinear', 'lbfgs'])
    max_iter = trial.suggest_int('max_iter', 100, 2000)
    class_weight = trial.suggest_categorical('class_weight', [None, 'balanced'])

**Best Performing Model 1 (Pre-Call): Logistic Regression**

The Optuna optimization confirmed that the undersampling approach was already near-optimal. While the hyperparameter tuning provided only marginal improvements in the F1 score, it validated our model selection and provided confidence in the robustness of our approach. The final model maintains the critical 62% subscriber capture rate while ensuring stable, production-ready predictions.

## Final Business Recommendations for Model 1 (Pre-Call)

### Key Achievements

1. **High Subscriber Capture Rate**: The final model successfully identifies **62% of all potential subscribers** before any calls are made, enabling the bank to capture the majority of revenue opportunities.

2. **Significant Efficiency Gain**: Compared to calling all 8,000 customers:
   - **Current approach**: Call 3,109 customers to capture 337 subscribers
   - **Without model**: Would need to call all 8,000 customers to capture all 545 subscribers
   - **Efficiency improvement**: 61% reduction in call volume while maintaining 62% of subscriber capture

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - **Cost per call**: Assuming $5 per call
   - **Revenue per subscriber**: Assuming $500 per term deposit
   - **With model**: 3,109 calls × $5 = $15,545 cost, 337 subscribers × $500 = $168,500 revenue
   - **ROI**: $152,955 net profit (984% return on investment)

## Next Steps

1. **Post-Call Model Development**: Repeat the analysis for Model 2 using all features including campaign-related variables
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Perform unsupervised clustering on actual subscribers to identify key behavioral patterns

## 🧩 Customer Segmentation Analysis

### Analyzing Subscriber Base

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Total subscribers analyzed:** 2,896
- **Features for clustering:** 13 (8 categorical, 5 numerical)
- **Data dimensions:** 2,896 rows × 13 columns

### 🔍 Clustering Results

**Optimal Configuration:**
- **Number of clusters:** 2
- **Silhouette Score:** 0.792 (excellent cluster separation)

### 📊 Cluster Distribution

| Cluster | Subscribers | Percentage | Profile |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **0**   | 2,721       | 94.0%      | Mainstream subscribers |
| **1**   | 175         | 6.0%       | Niche high-value segment |

### Key Insights

1. **Clear Segmentation:** The high silhouette score (0.792) indicates two very distinct customer groups
2. **Dominant Segment:** 94% of subscribers share similar characteristics (Cluster 0)
3. **Premium Segment:** 6% form a unique group potentially requiring specialized treatment

### Business Applications

**For Cluster 0 (Mainstream):**
- Standardized marketing campaigns
- Volume-based strategies
- General product offerings

**For Cluster 1 (Niche):**
- Personalized outreach
- Premium service offerings
- Dedicated account management

### Next Steps for Segmentation
1. Deep-dive analysis into distinguishing features between clusters
2. Develop targeted strategies for each segment
3. Test differentiated approaches in next campaign

## 🎨 Dimensionality Reduction Visualization: Customer Segments

### What the Plots Show

#### **Left: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- **Purpose:** Linear dimensionality reduction to project high-dimensional customer features into 2D
- **Interpretation:**
  - Each point is a subscriber, colored by their assigned cluster
  - The clusters are separated, but the spread along the x-axis (PC1) is very large, indicating some features have much higher variance or larger numeric scales than others
  - The lack of scaling causes some points to be far from the main cluster, which can distort the visualization and make cluster separation less clear
  - Most data points are concentrated near the origin, with a few outliers stretching far to the right

#### **Right: t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
- **Purpose:** Nonlinear dimensionality reduction, better at preserving local structure and revealing clusters in complex data
- **Interpretation:**
  - Each point is a subscriber, colored by cluster
  - t-SNE forms more compact and visually separated clusters, even without scaling
  - The yellow cluster (minority segment) is clearly separated from the main purple cluster (majority segment), indicating strong group differences in the encoded features
  - The structure is more organic and less affected by outliers compared to PCA

### Key Takeaways

1. **Cluster Separation:** Both PCA and t-SNE show that the two clusters identified by KMeans are distinct, but t-SNE provides a clearer visual separation

2. **Effect of No Scaling:** The PCA plot is heavily influenced by the original feature scales, leading to stretched axes and outliers. t-SNE is less sensitive to this, but scaling is generally recommended for PCA

3. **Business Insight:** The minority cluster (yellow) likely represents a unique subscriber segment with different characteristics, which could be targeted with specialized marketing strategies

### Recommendation
For more interpretable PCA results, consider scaling your features before applying PCA. t-SNE can often reveal cluster structure even without scaling, but results may still improve with normalization.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis successfully developed a two-stage predictive modeling system for term deposit marketing:

1. **Pre-Call Model (Logistic Regression)**: Identifies 62% of potential subscribers before any contact, enabling efficient initial outreach
2. **Post-Call Model (XGBoost)**: Achieves 42% precision for follow-up decisions, quadrupling efficiency compared to pre-call predictions

The models demonstrate that intelligent handling of class imbalance and strategic feature selection can dramatically improve marketing ROI. By implementing these models, banks can reduce call volumes by 60% while maintaining high subscriber capture rates, creating a win-win scenario for both operational efficiency and revenue generation.

The additional customer segmentation insights provide a roadmap for future personalized marketing strategies, particularly for the identified 6% niche segment that may warrant premium service offerings.

## Model 2 (Post-Call) Evaluation Results

The Post-Call Model utilizes all available features, including campaign-related variables (duration, day, month, campaign) that were excluded from the Pre-Call model. This model aims to help determine which customers should continue receiving follow-up calls after initial contact.

### 1️⃣ Pre-Call Model (Model 1) — *Who to Call Before Any Campaign Contact*

- **What it predicts:**  
  Model 1 uses only demographic and financial data (age, job, balance, marital status, etc.) to **predict which customers are most likely to subscribe before any campaign contact is made**.
- **Business suggestion:**  
  - **Call these customers first:** The model flags a broader set of customers for initial outreach, prioritizing *subscriber capture* over minimizing false positives.
  - **Who gets flagged:**  
    - **Retirees, high-balance customers, and those aged 60+** are most likely to be flagged as high-potential subscribers.
    - **Younger customers (≤29)** also show above-average interest and are included.
    - **Middle-aged (30–59)**, while the largest group, are less likely to be flagged.
- **Performance:**  
  - **Accuracy:** ~62%
  - **Recall:** ~62% (captures most actual subscribers)
  - **F1 Score:** ~0.17
- **Business impact:**  
  - **Maximizes subscriber capture** by ensuring most potential subscribers are not missed.
  - **Accepts more false positives** (calls to non-subscribers) as a trade-off for higher recall.
  - **Enables smarter allocation** of call center resources.
